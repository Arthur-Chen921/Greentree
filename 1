Hello everyone, I am Qiushi Chen (Arthur) from Xi'an, China.

My majors are cultural studies and data systems, and I have served positions as client manager and AI agent engineer. I am currently working as a Knowledge Operation Assistant of Huawei.

I enjoy playing the piano, saxophone, cooking Chinese cuisine, swimming, reading detective novels by Jo Nesbo, and playing Werewolf.

I am delighted to join the Huawei family and hope that my hard work can become a reliable support for you.

And I have been learning French and Spanish recently welcome to me for language exchange.
